1 / 1
2 / 2
3 / 3
4 / 4
5 / 5
7 / 7

OR:
9p (PC) /25p (A020):
Shield(or 5) / 1
3 / 2
2 / 3
7 / 4
8 / 5
5 / 7

you may use a normal Terminal-Programm with the following Transmission codes:

1 Startbit
7 Bit per Character
1 Signal Parity even
1 Stopbit

The Baudrate normaly is 9600. (Possible others: 4800,2400,1200,600,300)
You should get message:
